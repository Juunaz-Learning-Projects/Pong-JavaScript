The objective of the game is very simple: protect the edge of the border where your racket is positioned. To do so, you must hit the ball whenever it points in your direction.

<h2> Controls </h2>

The controls used in this game refer to the left paddle, since the right paddle is automated.

- **Up arrow [↑]:** moves the paddle up.
- **Down arrow [↓]:** moves the paddle down.
